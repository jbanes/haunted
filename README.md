# haunted
A classic Usborne text adventure ported to an SDL interface for RetroFW. 

The original *Haunted House* adventure was written in BASIC and published in the [Usborne](https://usborne.com/browse-books/features/computer-and-coding-books/) book [Write your own Adventure Programs for your Microcomputer](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxv0SsvibDMTYkFJbUswOHFQclE).

The adventure was [ported to C](https://www.seasip.info/ZX/haunted.html) by John Elliott. 

This port builds upon Mr. Elliott's port by adding a graphical interface and gamepad-style controls. Input is via directional pad and menus rather than typing.
